# wordpressDevOps


Description:
The Terraform.tf file contains a terraform script which would be used for initializing the following instances on AWS:
1. An EC2 instance [t4g.micro]
2. An RDS instance [t4g.micro]
3. Wordpress Image from docker

In order for the script to run, the machine should have terraform and docker desktop installed and active at the time of execution. Also, the AWS account needs to be connected in the terraform script with the help of access keys. I have withheld my access keys for obvious reasons.
